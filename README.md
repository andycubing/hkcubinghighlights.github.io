# HK Cubing Highlights

This repository contains the source for a GitHub Pages site. The files are at the repository root and the branch is main.

Preview locally:

- Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`
- VS Code: install Live Server extension and "Open with Live Server"

Publish with GitHub Pages:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub → Settings → Pages
2. Under "Source" choose Branch: `main` and folder `/ (root)` → Save
3. Wait a minute. The site will be available at:
   `https://andycubing.github.io/hkcubinghighlights.github.io`

Notes:
- If you intended a user site (https://andycubing.github.io) the repository name must be `andycubing.github.io`. If you want that I can rename or recreate the repo.
- To use a custom domain add a `CNAME` file with the domain and configure DNS at your registrar.

If you want, I can also add a CNAME, or create a repo named `andycubing.github.io` for a user site instead.
